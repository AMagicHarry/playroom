Adds keybinding for wrapping the current selection in a tag.

Pressing <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd></kbd> (or, on Windows, <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd></kbd>) will wrap the currently selected text in an empty fragment that is ready to be typed in.

Works for single cursors (doesn't wrap anything), single line selections, multi-line selections, and multiple cursors.
